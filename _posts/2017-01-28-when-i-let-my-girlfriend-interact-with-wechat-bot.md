Since the time I've moved to Shenzhen, I experimented with WeChat bot and its platform quite enough to have some times to enjoy its moment.

During development of my WeChat Bot codenamed FKit, I chanaged its functionality to only shout out "i Love u" as I want my girlfriend to interact with it no matter the input message.

Here is what I captured the conversation she talked with my bot. I captured it via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)'s web interface.

> You might wonder how can I decrypt the message as it should be done via https and WeChat platform's encryption. I can as I disable encryption during the time of development. Surely for production, encryption would be back on.

She began with `test` first.

Then she followed up by calling me `stupid frog` !

She sent a sticker but my WeChat bot doesn't support receiving this kind of message yet, thus it showed out as (translated to English) `not support message`.

Same to previously message.

Then she ended the conversation with `okie`.

That's fun time ðŸ˜‚
