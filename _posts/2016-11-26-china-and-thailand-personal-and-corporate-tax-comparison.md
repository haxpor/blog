*Taxing* is the very first thing to consider when basing yourself in another country for long term.

Especially if you open and operate business there in China, you need to involve both `corporate tax` and `individual tax`.

## Reference Case

Let's take a simple case getting rid of any `allowance` which can be complicated to know as it's different from one to another in each country. Thus we set it to `0`.

The following case is set for easy comparison.

**Case:** Assume company gets monthly income at the rate <span style="color: blue;">`100,000.00 THB`</span> or <span style="color: red;">`19,413.65  RMB`</span>. In 1 year, company gets <span style="color: blue;">`1,200,000.00 THB`</span> or <span style="color: red;">`232,963.80 RMB`</span>.

> Use <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> for Thai Baht, and <span style="color: red;">red</span> for Chinese Yuan for clearer visual at a glance.


## Corporate tax

Accomponay with the list of tax for all country [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates).

### China

Although as listed in link above, China's corporate tax is at `25%`. Shenzhen is in special economic zone. It's also accoridng to the type of company you would be registering. For `FIPE` which stands for `China Foreign Invested Partnership Enterprise`, with it tax is `0%`, or simply no tax at all. You get all the money to your company entity.

In summary:  

* Tax <span style="color: red;">`0 RMB`</span> or <span style="color: blue;">`0 THB`</span> in case of special economic area such as Shenzhen.
* Tax <span style="color: red;">`58,240.94 RMB`</span> or <span style="color: blue;">`300,000.00 THB`</span> which is `25%`

### Thailand

Plainly, it's 20%.

In summary:  

* Tax <span style="color: red;">`46,592.75 RMB`</span> or <span style="color: blue;">`240,000.00 THB`</span>

### Comparison

You need to pay `20%` for corporate tax in Thailand compared to `none` for special economic area in China such as Shenzhen.

or

You need to pay `5%` less for corporate tax in Thailand compared to business in non-economic area in China.

## Individual tax

Slightly needs effort in calculation. Assume that when you got money into company, you want to get all of that money out each month. Thus all the amount will be applied for individual tax.

### China

Best link I found about individual income tax (IIT) in China can be seen [here](http://www.shanghaihalfpat.com/income-tax-for-foreigners-in-china/).

I take the image from the link and show it here for easy reference.
![IIT table](http://www.shanghaihalfpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-19-at-PM-03.29.34.png)

Use 2 main equations as follows

* `Taxable Income` = `Total Income` - `Initial Deduction` - `Tax Deductible Allowance`
* `Tax Payable` = (`Taxable Income` x `Tax Rate`) - `Deduction`

> In which `Tax Deductible Allowance` is assumed to be `0`, and `Initial Deduction` is `4,800 RMB` as it's for of expat. See provided link for more information.

We can work it out as follows.

Gross salary = `19,413.65  RMB` / month  
Taxable income = `19,413.65` - `4,800` = `14,613.65 RMB`  
Tax Rate = `25%`  
Deduction = `1,005 RMB`  
Tax = `14,613.65` * `0.25` - `1,005` = `2,648.41 RMB` / month = `31,780.92 RMB` / year.

In summary: Tax = <span style="color: red;">`31,780.92 RMB`</span> or <span style="color: blue;">`163,704.17 THB`</span>

### Thailand

There's new individual tax structure that aimed to use starting in 2017. You can see it [here](http://money.kapook.com/view146451.html) (in Thai), or official [pdf](http://www.rd.go.th/publish/fileadmin/user_upload/news/news15_2559.pdf). Both provide the same information.

I grap the image and show it for convenience below.
![thai individual tax](http://img.kapook.com/u/2016/supparat/Infographic_2016/info-Vat2560-600.jpg)

We can work it out as follows.

Total Income / Year = `1,200,000 THB`  
Deduct rate = `40%` (but total not more than `60,000 THB`)  
Deduct amount = `1,200,000` * `0.4` = `480,000 THB` which is more than `60,000 THB` then it becomes `60,000 THB`  
Deducted Income = `1,200,000` - `60,000` = `1,140,000 THB`  
Tax = (`1,140,000` - `150,000`) * `0.25` = `247,500 THB`

In summary: Tax = <span style="color: red;">`48,048.77 RMB`</span> or <span style="color: blue;">`247,500.00 THB`</span>

### Comparison

You need to pay individual tax in Thailand `33.86%` more compared to tax in China. 

## In Conclusion

Now it depends on one big factor of `allowance` as we assume it to be `0` in both tax calculation for both China and Thailand for both type of corporate and individual tax.

In Thailand, there might be more options of allowance available, but seemingly less in China and possibly slighly hard to get.

Thus watch out for this factor. But at the moment, we can see that doing business in special economic area such as Shenzhen in China is good for reducing corporate tax down to `0%`, and even without such area; individual tax is still less than by merely `33.86%` in China compared to Thailand.
