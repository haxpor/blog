   An independent game developers meetup in Bangkok Iâ€™ve organized, and now transformed into IndiedevBkk. It will be transformed again to be completely virtual.

   This project was aimed to be a successor of [indie gamedev meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Indie-game-developers-and-development/) I've organized in Bangkok; which now I stepped down. Later due to time, and I'm not always in Bangkok thus it is no longer in pipeline.

  I've moved to China since February 2017. Most of the time I spent on WeChat, there're interesting Chinese contents to digest. But I didn't know Chinese thus I create a tool to help me translate Chinese article back to English. So this helps me to not spend time elsewhere away from WeChat itself.

  It uses Baidu as a backend to translate. Project is based on NodeJS hooked up with WeChat platform on webhook to receive user's input text, and adhere to WeChat's messaging format (based on XML) to properly send/receive message.

  The project's source code can be found on github [here](https://github.com/haxpor/fkit).

  You can use WeChat to scan the following QR Code to use it.

  HeaTap is my first published WeChat's mini-program. It's location-based app for users to mark point-of-interest right inside WeChat.
