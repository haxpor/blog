I've moved to China since February 2017. Most of the time I spent on WeChat, there're interesting Chinese contents to digest. But I didn't know Chinese thus I create a tool to help me translate Chinese article back to English. So this helps me to not spend time elsewhere away from WeChat itself.

It uses Baidu as a backend to translate. Project is based on NodeJS hooked up with WeChat platform on webhook to receive user's input text, and adhere to WeChat's messaging format (based on XML) to properly send/receive message.

The project's source code can be found on github [here](https://github.com/haxpor/fkit).

You can use WeChat to scan the following QR Code to use it.
