An old school beatâ€™em up game on iOS that lets you play as Kiki to punch, kick and perform combos against horde of once heroes but turned into brainless zombies.

I was working with another 2 guys (one artist and one producer) under [Secret Character](http://secret-character.com/) collaborating a few outsource for art assets, and sfx to make the [game](http://zombie-hero.com/).
I took responsibility on programming part, and technological side to make the vision happens.
