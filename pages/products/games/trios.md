Trois is a game made in 72 hours during Ludumdare 25 (combo). I made this game with [@suebphatt](https://twitter.com/suebphatt) as I take care of programming part, and he took care of art asset but at the end due to time constraint and mis-communication, art asset was never used in the game.

You control the tripod alien trying to get from one place to another by controlling and well-managing its individual leg to pull up/down and avoid falling.
